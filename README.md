# Forest

> The woods are lovely, dark and deep,  
> But I have promises to keep,  
> And miles to go before I sleep,  
> And miles to go before I sleep.

This is the syntax of the deep woods. A dark, earthy theme for Atom editor that's easy on the eyes, providing the needful calm for long coding sessions.

This theme found inspiration in the Monokai Extended theme for Sublime Text, the Birds of Paradise theme for TextMate, and the Robin Hood theme for Atom.
