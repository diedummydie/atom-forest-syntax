# Forest

> The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
> But I have promises to keep,
> And miles to go before I sleep,
> And miles to go before I sleep.

The syntax of the deep woods. A dark, earthy theme for Atom editor that's easy on the eyes, providing a quiet calm for long coding sessions.

Inspired by the Monokai Extended theme for Sublime Text, the Birds of Paradise theme for TextMate, and the Robin Hood theme for Atom.
