# Forest

Forest is a dark, earthy theme for Atom that provides a warm, comfortable environment for long coding sessions. Forest eliminates distractions with a warm pallette and minimum contrast for items like invisibles, indent and wrap guides, and line numbers.

These shots feature 'One Dark UI' which adapts well to this theme and the 'minimap' package. Forest was inspired by Monokai for Sublime Text, Birds of Paradise for TextMate, and the deep woods.
